Hello lovely tutors,

If you follow the steps in this ReadMe, nothing will go wrong. But if not, we cannot rule out anything, 
not even a fourth Covid-19 wave.
Speaking of Covid-19, have you ever wondered how the RKI comes up with its beautiful plots and diagrams? 

No? Well, then get outta here!

Yes? Great. You have found the perfect Basic Python Final Project to satisfy your curiosity.

1. To start of your exploration, clone this repository on your local computer.

2. Open the editor, so that you see the Gib-Hub project "BasicPython_CoronaPlot" on your local computer.

3. Now, you have to add the RKI data. And because it is too big to store on GitHub, you have to trust me for once
   and follow this dropbox-link: 
   "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b3uxat5msd28o2n/AADLltlil5HYBYsKokLvDEKqa?dl=0" (don't worry, it's safe. Scout's honor!).
   
4. Download the two csv files (RKI_Corona_Landkreise & RKI_COVID19) and unpack them into a folder with the name "data".
   Next up, store this folder in the GitHub-project "BasicPython_CoronaPlot" alongside the folders "documentation",
   "loadAndClean", "main", and "visualization".
   
5. Now that you are finished with setting up the data, you can open the folder "main".
   Open "Main.py" in your preferred IDE. Before running it, however, make sure that you have installed the following 
   packages in your Python Interpreter: 'pandas', 'matplotlib', 'numpy'.
   
Have fun exploring the data!

Everything else can be found in the folder "documentation".
